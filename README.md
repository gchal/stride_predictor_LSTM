# stride_predictor_LSTM
1. LSTM regression model for predicitng future lengths of human strides. Stride lengths are corellated to the optimal distance between human
and robotic assistant rollator.
2. LSTM regression model for predicitng the possible relative orientations of the coupled robot-human motion. 

Both learned from real patient data, extracted from a MoCap system.
